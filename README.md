# Fish Weight Prediction API 

## Overview
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict the weight of a fish based on its species and physical measurements. The model is deployed using **Flask**, and a simple **web interface** allows users to input fish attributes and receive predictions.

## Project Components
**ML Model:** Trained using `RandomForestRegressor` for accurate predictions.  
**Flask API:** Handles incoming requests and serves predictions.  
**Web Interface:** HTML/CSS-based frontend for user interaction.  
**Postman Testing:** API tested for correctness before deployment.
